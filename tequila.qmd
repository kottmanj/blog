Tequila is an abstraction framework for (variational) quantum algorithms.
It operates on abstract data structures allowing the formulation, combination, automatic differentiation and optimization of generalized objectives. Tequila can execute the underlying quantum expectation values on state of the art simulators as well as on real quantum devices.  

This [blog](index.qmd), contains some hands-on examples using tequila. A good starting point is [here](posts/tq-get-started/index.qmd).

# Contribute

Tequila is free an open source. You're welcome to contribute if you have ideas to improve the library.  
The standard way to contribute is via pull-requests or issues on [github](https://github.com/tequilahub/tequila#how-to-contribute). For larger projects it might be useful to let me know in advance what you are planning.  

# Influences

The design of tequilas API was inspired by [madness](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01888). Angostic backend handeling and forcing differetiability was inspired by [pennylane](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04968v3).
