Welcome to this blog.  
  
  

My friend and former co-worker [Kjell](https://www.valencekjell.com/) introduced me to [quarto](https://quarto.org/) - a publishing system for scientific and technical content. It is quite amazing and I pledge to make good use of it in the near future.  

If you are thinking about using quarto yourself, I recommend their online guide. The guide for blogs is for example [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html). The source files for this blog can be found [here](https://github.com/kottmanj/blog/), they might be useful in creating your own blog.
