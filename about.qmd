I'm a TT Professor at the department of computer at the University of Augsburg.  
My research interests are in quantum algorithms, quantum chemistry and scientific computing.  
 
Previously I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto where I was part of the matter lab leading the development of the [tequila](https://github.com/tequilahub/tequila) library. Before that I did my PhD with Florian Bischoff working on multiresolution quantum chemistry with [madness](https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness).  

See posts in this [blog](index.qmd) for some hands-on code examples.
